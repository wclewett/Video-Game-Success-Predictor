# Video Game Success Predictor
For the final data project, our team put together a machine learning app that allows the user to pitch a game idea and recieve back a prediction on how well it would do with players. To gather our dat, we webscraped titles, reviews, and ratings from IGDB and used a random forest model to power the prediction. This application is not currently available online due to the free tier's server memory limit at herokuapp.
